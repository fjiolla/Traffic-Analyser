Released: March 22, 2026

- **Voice Endpoint** (`POST /api/chat/voice`): Accepts audio `UploadFile`, transcribes via Groq Whisper (`whisper-large-v3-turbo`) using key rotation, passes transcript to `narrative_agent.chat()`, returns `{transcript, response, rag_sources}`.

Released: March 22, 2026

- **RAG Injection into Narrative Agent**: `narrative_agent.py` now calls `retrieve_sops(user_message, top_k=2)` before every chat response. SOP content injected into LLM context — questions like "What's the flooding protocol?" receive answers grounded in actual SOP documents.
- **RAG Sources in Response**: `ChatResponse` schema updated with `rag_sources: list[str]`. `/api/chat` returns document names used.
- **Source Badges in ChatInterface**: RAG-grounded assistant messages show collapsible "📄 Sources" badges. Click to see which SOP documents were referenced.

## v2.4.0 — Route Intelligence: Toggle Mode, Geocoding, Priority, Weather, Coloring

Released: March 22, 2026

- **Route Finder** (`backend/core/route_finder.py`): Loads Brooklyn OSMnx graph, converts `MultiDiGraph → DiGraph` (fixes `NetworkXNotImplemented` crash). Computes live edge weights from feed speed + risk + weather penalty + vehicle-type multiplier. Uses `nx.shortest_simple_paths` for top-K routes.
- **Vehicle Priority Routing**: `ambulance` (0.6×), `police` (0.65×), `fire_brigade` (0.7×) weight multipliers. Emergency vehicles also get reduced risk weighting and signal preemption intersection lists from SOP 04.
- **3-Route Color Ranking**: Lowest composite score → GREEN `#22c55e` (optimal); middle → YELLOW `#f59e0b` (moderate); highest → RED `#ef4444` (risky). Routes follow actual Brooklyn road geometry.
- **Composite Route Score**: `0.25×density + 0.30×travel_time + 0.25×accident + 0.20×weather`.
- **Mapbox Geocoding Proxy** (`GET /api/geocode?q=...`): Brooklyn-scoped (`-74.05,40.57,-73.83,40.74`) forward geocoding via Mapbox Search API.
- **`POST /api/routes`** and **`GET /api/routes/csv`** endpoints added.
- **Dashboard Mode Toggle**: Segmented control "Map Overview | Route Planning" in dashboard top bar.
- **Search Boxes in TrafficMap**: Debounced geocoding autocomplete (300ms), click-to-set origin/destination, green START / red END markers, crosshair cursor in route mode. Route lines rendered as colored LineString layers; click to select.
- **Vehicle Type Selector**: Dropdown (Normal / Ambulance / Police / Fire Brigade) visible in Route Planning mode.
- **RoutingPanel Route Cards**: Left color bar, rank badge, 4-metric grid (time/distance/density/risk), weather penalty indicator, street name sequence, signal preemption list for emergency vehicles, CSV Export button.
- **New Types/Store**: `CandidateRoute`, `RouteRequest`, `RouteResponse`, `GeocodeSuggestion`, `VehicleType`; `dashboardMode`, `candidateRoutes`, `vehicleType`, `routeOrigin`, `routeDestination` in Zustand store.

## v2.3.0 — Hotspot Prediction (DBSCAN)

Released: March 22, 2026

- **Hotspot Predictor** (`backend/core/hotspot_predictor.py`): Generates 500 synthetic accident records weighted by OSMnx road type, proximity to the 21 known Brooklyn hotspots, time-of-day, and severity. Runs DBSCAN (`eps=0.0008, min_samples=4, haversine metric`) to produce accident cluster zones.
- **`/api/hotspots/predicted` Endpoint**: Returns `HotspotCluster[]` with `center_lat`, `center_lon`, `accident_count`, `severity_score`, `risk_score`, `radius_m`, `peak_hours`. Distinct from existing `/api/hotspots` (static 21 known hotspots).
- **Map Visualization**: Semi-transparent graduated red circles on the Brooklyn map. Circle radius proportional to `risk_score`. Tooltip: "Predicted Hotspot — N incidents, risk score X".
- **Schema**: `HotspotCluster` added to `backend/models/schemas.py`.

## v2.2.0 — Weather Intelligence

Released: March 22, 2026

- **Weather Service** (`backend/core/weather_service.py`): Fetches real Brooklyn weather from Weather.gov API (free, no key). Caches for 15 minutes. Returns `WeatherCondition(condition, temp_f, precip_pct, wind_mph, is_severe)`.
- **Road Vulnerability Classification**: Brooklyn roads classified as flood-prone (Belt Pkwy, Gowanus area), ice/wind-prone (bridges, BQE), or snow-accumulation (Eastern Pkwy, Ocean Pkwy). `get_weather_penalty()` returns 1.0–3.0 multiplier per road + weather combination.
- **`/api/weather` Endpoint**: Returns current `WeatherCondition` for the Brooklyn area.
- **Weather Widget in Sidebar**: Icon (☀️/🌧️/❄️) + temperature + condition, color-coded green/yellow/orange/red based on severity.
- **Schema**: `WeatherCondition` added to `backend/models/schemas.py`.

## v2.1.0 — Core Infrastructure: Real Time, Key Rotation, Dynamic Stats

Released: March 22, 2026

- **API Key Rotation** (`backend/core/key_manager.py`): Thread-safe Groq + Gemini key pools parsed from comma-separated env vars (`GROQ_API_KEYS`, `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEYS`). Auto-rotates on 429 rate-limit errors, falls back to primary keys.
- **Real Wall-Clock Time**: Replaced `_simulated_hour` fixed value with `datetime.now()` in `feed_engine.py` — sidebar now shows actual current time.
- **Flow-Based Diversion Volume**: Replaced `random.uniform()` in `routing_agent.py` with a computation derived from blocked segment density vs. route segment density.
- **Dynamic Confidence Scores**: Supervisor (`supervisor.py`) now derives per-agent confidence from live data (`mean(s.confidence for s in signals)`, diversion confidence, weighted overall) instead of hardcoded defaults (0.7/0.8).
- **Cascade Risk Computation**: Cascade risk in Supervisor derived from diversion route average risk vs. incident risk ratio — no longer hardcoded `0.0`.
- **"Current Time" Label**: Sidebar label changed from "Simulated Time" to "Current Time".
